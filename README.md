# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## Introduction

**Market Basket Analysis:** 
Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more or less likely to buy another group of items. Market basket analysis may provide the retailer with information to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.

Market basket analysis might tell a retailer that customers often purchase shampoo and conditioner together, so putting both items on promotion at the same time would not create a significant increase in revenue, while a promotion involving just one of the items would likely drive sales of the other.

**Instacart:** 
Instacart is an American technology company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick up service in the U.S. and Canada. Customers shop for groceries through the Instacart mobile app or Instacart.com from various retailer partners. The order is shopped and delivered by an Instacart personal shopper.

### Objectives:
- Analyze the anonymized data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users open sourced by Instacart 
- Find out hidden association between products for better cross-selling and upselling
- Perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing and anticipate customer behavior
- Find out reorder probabilities of products for better shelf space optimization
- Carry out collaborative filtering for products recommendation 

## Data Description

- **aisles:** This file contains different aisles and there are total 134 unique aisles.

- **departments:** This file contains different departments and there are total 21 unique departments.
- **orders:** This file contains all the orders made by different users. From below analysis, we can conclude following:
    - There are total 3421083 orders made by total 206209 users.
    - There are three sets of orders: Prior, Train and Test. The distributions of orders in Train and Test sets are similar whereas the distribution of orders in Prior set is different.
    - The total orders per customer ranges from 0 to 100.
    - Based on the plot of 'Orders VS Day of Week' we can map 0 and 1 as Saturday and Sunday respectively based on the assumption that most of the people buy groceries on weekends.
    - Majority of the orders are made during the day time.
    - Customers order once in a week which is supported by peaks at 7, 14, 21 and 30 in 'Orders VS Days since prior order' graph.
    - Based on the heatmap between 'Day of Week' and 'Hour of Day,' we can say that Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings are prime time for orders.

    - The percentage of reorder items in this set is 59.86%.
    
 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
For the analysis I combined all of the separate data files into one single dataframe and to fit the dataframe in my memory I reduced its size to 50% (4.1 GB to 2.0 GB) by type conversion and without loosing any information.

- This plot shows most popular aisles based on total products bought.

</p>

- As we can see in below plot that the reorder percentage of day-to-day food items is high and for other products such as vitamins, first-aids, beauty products, etc. reorder percentage is low. This is true as we buy only groceries regularly and do not buy those items in every order.

- The above plot shows popular departments. The store layout should be in a way that popular departments are very near to each other.

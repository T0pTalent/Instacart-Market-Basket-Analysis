# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## Introduction

**Market Basket Analysis:** 
Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more or less likely to buy another group of items. Market basket analysis may provide the retailer with information to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.

Market basket analysis might tell a retailer that customers often purchase shampoo and conditioner together, so putting both items on promotion at the same time would not create a significant increase in revenue, while a promotion involving just one of the items would likely drive sales of the other.

**Instacart:** 
Instacart is an American technology company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick up service in the U.S. and Canada. Customers shop for groceries through the Instacart mobile app or Instacart.com from various retailer partners. The order is shopped and delivered by an Instacart personal shopper.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order using the anonymized data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users open sourced by Instacart.

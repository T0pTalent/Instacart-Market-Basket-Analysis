    "**Market Basket Analysis** : Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more or less likely to buy another group of items. Market basket analysis may provide the retailer with information to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market basket analysis might tell a retailer that customers often purchase shampoo and conditioner together, so putting both items on promotion at the same time would not create a significant increase in revenue, while a promotion involving just one of the items would likely drive sales of the other."
